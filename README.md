==================

This is an auxiliary repository for deployment to GitHub Pages.

Its contents are automatically generated from the source at https://github.com/latasker/lucytasker.com

There is no need to edit any files here by hand. The automated deployment workflow that runs on changes and every night 
will overwrite such changes in any case.

The file called `CNAME` is important for GitHub Pages custom domain settings to work
in the current setup (publishing from a branch).
